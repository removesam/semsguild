## Semal Lore

Sem was born to an impoverished family living in the slums of a wealthy merchant's city called Feros. She spent her childhood begging, foraging and scrounging for food. With only a father to look after her, Sem spent her time in the streets while he was away at work. She and the other slum children would wander into the markets to beg the wealthy for handouts when one day, one of the children fell ill. Sem, one of the oldest in the group, took it upon herself to care for the child, an orphan boy of only 6 years. When it was clear that the child needed medicine, Sem resorted to stealing from street merchants to trade for the remedy that the boy needed. Sem felt proud that she could take care of the village children and soon found herself stealing on a regular basis.

Sem had acquired a small sum of money and was taught the basics of reading and writing from a storyteller who required a cheap scribe. Sem was interested in the concept that telling stories could earn her money, whether they were real or not. Sem gave the storyteller a small sum of money for lessons, and he would give her a stale bread bun for every page she wrote. She would teach the village children too, drawing letters in the dirt with sticks.

Sem's father returned one day in a panic, packing up their few belongings. He exclaimed that the slums were no longer safe and that they had to leave immediately. Sem was upset and didn't want to leave the children to fend for themselves. Against her will she was dragged through the streets by her father as soldiers began to storm the streets. 

A few days later, the Feros slums that Semhal once called home were eradicated. Buildings were erected in place of huts and soon the city expanded to the desert's edge, engulfing any evidence of the slums' existence.

Semhal and her father roamed from town to village to find odd jobs and make ends meet. Whenever work couldn't be found, Sem would revert to her old antics, despite her father's discontent. Eventually he stopped making her return the stolen belongings  and apologize because he could not provide for the both of them. Semhal had little labour skill, and reading nor writing were required skills in the small settlements they visited. 

Sem's father lost his life in the village Emal when they had been caught for stealing. When it came to the confession, Sem's father took the blame despite her cries. Sem, now alone, wandered, lost and hopeless. She got in trouble with a gang while trying to steal their rations. They noticed her decent criminal skill and her ability to read and she joined them for a number of years, learning the ins and outs of being a true criminal.

When morals diverged, Semhal ended up leaving the group and resumed her solo travels, picking up lost souls along the way. Eventually she settled down and started her own guild.
