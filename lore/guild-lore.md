[Back to The Hub]()
Semhal spent the majority of her life caring for those who found themselves in unfortunate circumstnaces and those who are weak. While travelling around Jegovar, Sem observed a lot of injustice, and would attempt to help those in need whenever possible. She also encountered a lot of lost souls with nowhere to go, and pledged to them a better life. Eventually, her party grew to large to adventure, thus the guild was created to continue 
sem's mission of helping those who are less fortunate.
