Vicmeral
Born with the shadow curse making him physically weak, Vic had a hard time growing up in the shadowfell. Although showing promising intelligence, physical limitations resulted in severe sickness when exertion was required. Sheltered for most of his life, his parents were eventually imprisoned/ enslaved for hiding their youngest child. Now an orphan, Vic was deemed useless to the queen's society, and exiled for his inability to fight, thus he began fading and had accepted his destiny to be forgotten from any land.

Sem was travelling through the land and came across Vic, nearly completely faded. Calling in a favour, Sem was able to have a cleric restore Vic's soul and he now wears a gal-ranan to negate the curse, visiting the shadow land only once a year, as necessary.
