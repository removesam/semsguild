## Iredell Lore  
A coven of hags lost their third and sought a suitable replacement. As a baby, Iredell was taken from her family and kept in a castle, far from civilization. She was isolated, but was treated decently well, spending most of her time with her nose in a book or practicing magic. As she aged she took on more responsibility, cleaning and cooking and doing other chores for the hags. Her studies were of the utmost importance, and she spent a vast majority researching healing and necromancy magic. Eventually she began running errands in a small neighbouring town, being told to keep to herself and to focus solely on her tasks. At one of the shops she frequented, the owner's son of similar age would often help her, and they developed a loving but secret relationship. One evening, the boy snuck off to visit Iredell in the castle but was caught by the hags and their romantic relationship was brought to light. The boy was killed by the hags and Iredell was distraught and began acting out. While sneaking around the castle one day in rebellion, Iredell uncovered the hags' secret plan to turn her into a hag for their coven and was terrified. She left the castle knowing very little about the outside world.
